        I am currently enrolled as a student at the Global Institute of
        Artificial Intelligence and Computing (GIAIC), where I am pursuing a
        comprehensive course focused on Artificial Intelligence, web 3.0, and
        the Metaverse. My passion for technology is the driving force behind my
        continuous pursuit of knowledge and skills, as I am committed to staying
        abreast of the latest innovations in the field. This dedication
        motivates me to engage in ongoing learning and skill development to
        ensure that I am well-equipped to contribute to the cutting-edge
        developments in technology.
